# Data Wrangling and Cleaning.

In this repo, I will use acquired messy datasets(their sources I'll outline accordingly) in an attempt, to the best of my ability, to clean them.

Used are Python libraries such as [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) for data manipulation, [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for data visualization.

Techniques used are on how to find and clean:
- Missing Data
- Irregular Data (Outliers)
- Unnecessary Data - Repetitive data and duplicates
- Inconsistent Data - Capitalization, addresses etc
